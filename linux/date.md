#### 1.2 样例
```shell
$ echo $(date +%Y%m%d %H%M%S)
date: extra operand ‘%H%M%S’
Try 'date --help' for more information.  //含有空格要用引号包起来


$ echo $(date +'%Y%m%d %H%M%S')
20180213 144320    //最常用的，要记一下

$ echo $(date +'%Y%m%d %H:%M:%S')
20180213 14:43:27  //换一个格式

$ echo $(date +'%y%m%d %H:%M:%S')
180213 14:43:49   //y表示年的后两位
